  korvax: `
Korvax Rend — once a decorated captain of the Astral Vanguard.
When the Shattered Star ruptured the void, he was the first to witness
the corruption spreading through the star lanes. Now he hunts the source,
guided only by duty and the ghosts of those he failed to save.
  `,

  lyria: `
Lyria Voss — a voidsinger whose voice once healed entire battalions.
But when the Star cracked, her song changed. She hears whispers now,
threads of impossible melody pulling her toward the heart of the corruption.
She follows, hoping to silence the void before it consumes her.
  `,

  auren: `
Auren Solari — exile, wanderer, and last scion of a forgotten order.
He alone recognizes the pattern in the corruption’s spread.
The Shattered Star calls to him, echoing ancient prophecies
that speak of a chosen spark who can rekindle the dying light.
  `,

  shade: `
Shade — a living anomaly, born from the Star’s first fracture.
Neither fully human nor fully voidborn, they walk the line between worlds.
The corruption obeys them… fears them… hungers for them.
Shade seeks answers — and perhaps a place to belong.
